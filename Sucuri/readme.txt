These are both php files, though the shebang at the top may need to
be changed in order to execute on your system.

gen-tests generates tests for common and edge cases; the dir should
be writable.

get-clients provides the solution to the coding challenge executed
against the input.csv file generated.

For further info on running, just type
   ./gen-tests -?
   ./get-clients -?
